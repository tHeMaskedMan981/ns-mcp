# Visas

## Malaysia

⚠️ **Important:** Be careful to not overstay your visa. The day you enter counts as a whole day towards your visa-free stay. So if you arrive in Malaysia on Aug 1 at 1pm and have 30 days visa-free, you must exit Malaysia by Aug 30 before 11:59pm.

### Short-term stays

165 nationalities are eligible for visa-free entry into Malaysia.

You can further verify travel requirements using the [Malaysia government website](https://www.imi.gov.my).

**Required:** Complete the [Malaysia Digital Arrival Card (MDAC)](https://imigresen-online.imi.gov.my/mdac/main) within 3 days of your entry into Malaysia.

**Address Information:**
- Address: Forest City Marina Hotel, Jalan Forest City 1, Pulau Satu
- State: Johor
- City: Gelang Patah
- Postcode: 81550

NS can provide an invitation letter and a booking confirmation if needed. Drop a message in the community channel if you need these documents.

### Long-term stays

Long-term stays can consider:
- [Malaysian Digital Nomad Visa](https://mdec.my/de-rantau-nomad-pass/)
- [MM2H visa](https://www.mm2h.gov.my/)

Those who can't get these visas and are only eligible for a 30-day entry into Malaysia, can usually go to Singapore or Indonesia before their visa expires, and then travel back to Malaysia to renew their 30-day visa.
